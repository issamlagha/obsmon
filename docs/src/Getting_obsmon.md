# [Getting obsmon](@id getting-the-source) 

## Downloading the source code 

Obsmon `v>=4.0.0` can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Hirlam/obsmon). Open the terminal and enter
the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Hirlam/obsmon.git` 

The obsmon repo contains two main branches: `master` (the default) and
`devel`. The `master` branch contains the official obsmon releases. The
`devel` branch is generally ahead of `master` and contains code that
will eventually make its way into the latter but needs some more testing
before that. If you want to collaborate, you should branch off from
`devel`.
